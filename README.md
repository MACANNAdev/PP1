 -  ### Business story
1 I want to introduce myself to the customer.I want to make them feel like they can reach out to me and that I am approachable so they can see themselves coming to my events.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Typography
        -   The logo, and headers sized text uses Bree Serif with serif as a fall back.
        Bree serif is described as friendly upright italic, which suits the UX intention to create a approachable and friendly impression.
    -   #### Images
        -   The large images on the main and from pages are attempting to create a sense of place where the user would like to be.
        -   The profile image associates a person with that place and further develops this theme.
        -   The events image portray what the events is about in the form of an image.
